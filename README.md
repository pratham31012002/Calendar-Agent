   ```env
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_key
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_openai_endpoint
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=your_api_version
   ```

4. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the LangGraph server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   langgraph dev --allow-blocking
   ```

2. **Start the frontend development server**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - LangGraph Server: `http://127.0.0.1:2024`
   - LangGraph Studio: `https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024`

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Once the app is running, you'll be prompted to enter:

- **Deployment URL**: The URL of the LangGraph server you want to chat with. This is `http://127.0.0.1:2024` if you're running the server locally.
- **Assistant/Graph ID**: The name of the graph, or ID of the assistant to use when fetching, and submitting runs via the chat interface. This is `calendar_agent` for this project.
- **LangSmith API Key**: (only required for connecting to deployed LangGraph servers) Your LangSmith API key to use when authenticating requests sent to LangGraph servers.

After entering these values, click `Continue`. You'll then be redirected to a chat interface where you can start chatting with your LangGraph server.
